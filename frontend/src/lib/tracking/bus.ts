/**
 * The browser-only facade over the event bus (PWP-910).
 *
 * A plain module on purpose — not a Pinia store, not a composable:
 *
 *   - it has to be callable from store actions and router guards, where no
 *     component instance exists;
 *   - it has to be callable from `entry-client.ts` before Pinia is even created;
 *   - a `reactive()` proxy over a 20-event queue and a dedupe Map is pure
 *     overhead, and makes the dedupe map observable for no reason.
 *
 * ── Why the SSR guard lives HERE and not in tracker.ts ──────────────────────
 *
 * `tracker.ts` buffers events until `setContext()` lands. On the server that
 * never happens and no subscriber is ever registered, so every server-side
 * `track()` appends to a module-scope array that is never drained. In a single
 * long-lived Node process that is unbounded growth, and a cross-request data
 * leak the moment anything does drain it.
 *
 * Guarding at the facade means the bundler sees `import.meta.env.SSR` as a
 * compile-time constant and eliminates the body outright, so the bus's state is
 * *unreachable* on the server rather than merely unused. `tracker.ts` itself
 * stays byte-identical to propeller-next's copy, so future syncs are a diff.

/**
 * Emit an event. Never throws — analytics must not affect the user flow, the
 * same invariant `lib/preprEvent.ts` already holds.
 *
 * `name` is the taxonomy union rather than `string`. The ingest silently DROPS
 * an unrecognised name, so a typo costs a metric with no error anywhere — which
 * is exactly how `propeller.address_default_changed` survived here. The shared
 * `tracker.ts` core keeps `string` because it is byte-identical across the three
 * storefronts; narrowing at this facade is what gives every call site in this
 * app a compile-time check.
