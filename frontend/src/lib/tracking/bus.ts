/**
 * The browser-only facade over the event bus (PWP-910).
 *
 * A plain module on purpose — not a Pinia store, not a composable:
 *
 *   - it has to be callable from store actions and router guards, where no
 *     component instance exists;
 *   - it has to be callable from `entry-client.ts` before Pinia is even created;
 *   - a `reactive()` proxy over a 20-event queue and a dedupe Map is pure
 *     overhead, and makes the dedupe map observable for no reason.
 *
 * ── Why the SSR guard lives HERE and not in tracker.ts ──────────────────────
 *
 * `tracker.ts` buffers events until `setContext()` lands. On the server that
 * never happens and no subscriber is ever registered, so every server-side
 * `track()` appends to a module-scope array that is never drained. In a single
 * long-lived Node process that is unbounded growth, and a cross-request data
 * leak the moment anything does drain it.
 *
 * Guarding at the facade means the bundler sees `import.meta.env.SSR` as a
 * compile-time constant and eliminates the body outright, so the bus's state is
 * *unreachable* on the server rather than merely unused. `tracker.ts` itself
 * stays byte-identical to propeller-next's copy, so future syncs are a diff.
